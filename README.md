MOOCS Knowledge
===============

Tell us what you saw, we'll tell you what you know.
---------------------------------------------------

Just tell which MOOCS (coursera, udaycity, youtube) you watched, and get an awesome profile page which summarizes your knowledge with nice graphs.

What kind of black magic is this ?
----------------------------------

We'll get the video content, analyze it with our state-of-the-art Machine Learning and Natural Language processing techniques such as hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Analysis.

Machine learning and data crawling scripts available [here](https://github.com/NLPHackers/Moocs-python).
